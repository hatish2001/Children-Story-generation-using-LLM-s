### Introduction 
- This report investigates the intersection of text and
  image generation through the evaluation of two
  OpenAI models for the purpose of generating
  childrenâ€™s fairy tales and corresponding images. The
  generated text underwent human evaluation and a
  readability prediction using a neural network model.
  The study aims to compare the performance of two
  OpenAI models through human assessment and
  linguistic analysis.
